# Wh.D. (Word Hint Doctor)
Whd is a vim plugin that can generate words based on training text to help non-English writer to improve their wording and have fun.

# Markov Chain (Primitive)
A very simple model to predict words and it only bases on the order # of words. If we have only a small amount of txt files this will work!

# Word RNN

# TODO
- [ ] Function that allow to refresh and add more training samples
- [ ] Consider punctuation in training text
- [ ] Use Word RNN? Remote server?
    - [ ] It's heavy to train txt with RNN but perhaps we could put it to a service, you can choose the favorite book from library and download the trained session.
    - [ ] Work locally is also okay if the training time is acceptable...
